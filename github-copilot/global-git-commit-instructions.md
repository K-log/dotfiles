# Git instructions

- If the current branch has a ticket number, include that ticket number at the begging of each commit. 
  - Example commit message format `[PROJ-1234] my commit message`
- Make commit messages simple and easy to read
- Avoid prefixing commit messages with things like `bug` or `refactor` or `feat`
