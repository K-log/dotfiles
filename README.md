# Dotfiles

Looking for Nix configs? Checkout the Nix branch! https://github.com/K-log/dotfiles/tree/nix-setup-framework


## Setup

Link all files to their locations rather than copying
```bash
cp -rsf ~/dotfiles/. ~
```

Alternatively, link a single file
```bash
ln -s -f ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
